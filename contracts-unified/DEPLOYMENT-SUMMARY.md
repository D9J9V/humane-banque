# Deployment Summary for Humane Banque

## Current Status

The deployment process to World Chain has been prepared with all necessary scripts and configuration:

1. **Environment Setup** ✅
   - `.env` file configured with all required addresses
   - Environment validation script created and tested

2. **Deployment Scripts** ✅
   - `DeployWorldChain.s.sol` - For hook deployment with proper flag encoding
   - `CreatePoolWorldChain.s.sol` - For pool creation
   - Both scripts sourced from successful Uniswap V4 hook deployment patterns

3. **Deployment Guide** ✅
   - `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` contains step-by-step instructions
   - Instructions follow official Uniswap V4 hook deployment guidelines

## Ready for Production Deployment

To deploy to World Chain, you need to:

1. Have a wallet with ETH on World Chain for gas fees (~$20-$50 worth should be sufficient)
2. Update your private key in `.env`
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Deploy hook with proper flag encoding
cd contracts-unified
source .env
forge script script/DeployWorldChain.s.sol --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv

# Update .env with HOOK_ADDRESS from output
# Then create the pool
forge script script/CreatePoolWorldChain.s.sol --rpc-url $ETH_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

Once deployed:
1. Update frontend configuration with the new hook address
2. Test lending and borrowing functionality
3. Monitor transactions and contract state

## Important Notes

- The AuctionRepoHook must have proper flag encoding to work with Uniswap V4
- We use HookMiner to find the right salt value for CREATE2 deployment
- Sort order matters for token pairs - USDC should be token0 and WLD should be token1
- World Chain is a production environment, so all transactions will consume real gas fees
