## Deployment Process (For Reference)

The deployment was completed using the following steps:

```bash
# Deploy hook with proper flag encoding
cd contracts-unified
source ../.env
forge script script/DeployWorldChain.s.sol --rpc-url https://worldchain-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/public --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv

# Updated .env with HOOK_ADDRESS from output
# Then created the pool (had to fix currency order)
forge script script/CreatePoolWorldChain.s.sol --rpc-url https://worldchain-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/public --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast -vvvv
```

## Important Technical Notes

- The AuctionRepoHook was deployed with proper flag encoding (`AFTER_INITIALIZE_FLAG`) for Uniswap V4
- We used HookMiner to find the right salt value for CREATE2 deployment
- Currency order was swapped to satisfy Uniswap V4 requirements (lower address must be currency0)
- Three markets were created with different maturities (30, 90, and 180 days)
- World ID integration is active and working with real verifications
