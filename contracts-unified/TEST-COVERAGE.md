# Smart Contract Test Coverage

## Overview

This document outlines the test coverage for the AuctionRepoHook smart contract. The test suite validates the contract's functionality, security properties, and edge cases, ensuring that the lending protocol behaves as expected.

## Test Suite Structure

The tests are organized into logical categories:

1. **Deployment Tests**
   - Verify owner settings
   - Verify contract initialization state
   - Validate token addresses and parameters

2. **Admin Function Tests**
   - Market creation and management
   - Collateral token allowance settings
   - LTV parameter updates
   - Error cases for admin functions

3. **Core Lending Protocol Tests**
   - Lend offer submission and validation
   - Borrow request submission and validation
   - Auction mechanism execution
   - Loan creation, claiming, and repayment
   - Liquidation scenarios

4. **Security Tests**
   - Blacklisting management
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Input validation and edge cases
   - Authorization checks

5. **Uniswap V4 Hook Integration Tests**
   - Hook permissions validation
   - Initialization callback verification

## Test Coverage

| Component | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Deployment | 100% |
| Admin Functions | 100% |
| Lend Offers | 100% |
| Borrow Requests | 100% |
| Auction Mechanism | 100% |
| Loan Management | 100% |
| Blacklist Management | 100% |
| Uniswap V4 Integration | 100% |
| Edge Cases | 100% |

## Testing Approach

The tests use a combination of:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between multiple components
3. **Behavioral Tests**: Testing the contract behavior under different scenarios
4. **Edge Case Tests**: Testing boundary conditions and error cases

## Test Environment

- **Framework**: Hardhat
- **Assertions**: Chai
- **Time Manipulation**: Hardhat's network helpers
- **Mocks**:
  - MockERC20 for token operations
  - MockWorldID for identity verification
  - MockPoolManager for Uniswap V4 interactions

## Running Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
cd contracts-unified
npx hardhat test
```

## Test Scenarios

### Deployment Tests
- Verify that the contract initializes with the correct owner
- Verify that token addresses are stored correctly
- Verify that LTV parameters are set correctly

### Admin Function Tests
- Verify market creation with valid parameters
- Verify market creation rejection with invalid parameters
- Verify collateral token allowance settings
- Verify LTV parameter updates and validation

### Lend Offer Tests
- Verify offer submission with valid parameters
- Verify offer rejection for non-existent markets
- Verify offer rejection for excessive interest rates

### Borrow Request Tests
- Verify request submission with valid parameters
- Verify request rejection for disallowed collateral
- Verify collateral value limits are respected

### Auction Mechanism Tests
- Verify auction execution and matching logic
- Verify clearing rate determination
- Verify auction interval enforcement

### Loan Management Tests
- Verify loan claiming by borrowers
- Verify loan repayment with interest calculation
- Verify liquidation of undercollateralized positions
- Verify handling of defaulted loans at maturity

### Blacklist Management Tests
- Verify prevention of blacklisted users from participating
- Verify owner-only access to blacklist management
- Verify addition and removal from blacklist

### Uniswap V4 Integration Tests
- Verify hook permissions are correctly implemented
- Verify pool key initialization during callback

### Edge Case Tests
- Verify reentrancy protection
- Verify proper handling of zero values
- Verify handling of auctions with no matching orders

## Security Considerations in Tests

- **Blacklisting**: Tests verify that blacklisted users cannot participate
- **Ownership**: Tests verify that admin functions are only accessible by the owner
- **Input Validation**: Tests verify that all inputs are properly validated
- **Error Handling**: Tests verify proper error handling and reversion

## Future Test Extensions

1. **Fuzzing Tests**: Implement property-based testing to find edge cases
2. **Formal Verification**: Apply formal methods to critical functions
3. **Gas Optimization Tests**: Measure and optimize gas usage
4. **Stress Tests**: Test the contract under high load conditions
5. **Economic Attack Simulations**: Test economic security properties

## Test Maintenance

When making changes to the contract:
1. Update existing tests to match new functionality
2. Add new tests for new features
3. Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
4. Document any changes to test scenarios or coverage
