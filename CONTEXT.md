# Humane Banque Project - Current Progress & Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

We've built a solid foundation for Humane Banque, a fixed-term DeFi lending platform exclusive to verified humans:

### Authentication & Verification Infrastructure
- Implemented NextAuth with Worldcoin provider for secure sign-in
- Created a complete World ID verification flow:
  - Frontend components (SignInButton, VerifyButton) and custom hooks (useVerification)
  - Secure server-side verification endpoint (`/api/verify`) that validates proofs with World ID's Developer Portal
  - User verification status tracking via Supabase database

### Database & Backend
- Set up Supabase with tables for user profiles, loans, deposits, and defaulters
- Implemented Row Level Security policies to protect user data
- Created secure API routes for verification status and user data

### UI Foundation
- Built multi-screen architecture using Next.js App Router
- Implemented core navigation with AppLayout, Header, and TabBar components
- Created initial screens:
  - Landing page explaining the platform's value proposition
  - Dashboard with market information (currently using placeholder data)
  - Lending page with form inputs (simulation only)
- Applied DaisyUI components for consistent styling

## What's Missing / Next Steps

### 1. Core Financial Logic
- Implement the actual DeFi lending/borrowing mechanisms:
  - Connect to Uniswap V4 hooks or equivalent smart contracts
  - Create API endpoints for lending and borrowing operations
  - Add transaction signing via MiniKit
  - Implement rate discovery via periodic auctions

### 2. Data Integration
- Replace static placeholder data with real-time information:
  - Current market rates for different terms
  - Available liquidity in lending pools
  - User's portfolio and positions
  - Historical performance data

### 3. Complete User Flows
- Finish the "Borrow" screen and associated logic
- Create portfolio management screens:
  - Active loans and deposits
  - Collateral management
  - Repayment functionality
  - Liquidation warnings and handling

### 4. Security & Testing
- Conduct comprehensive security audit, especially for verification and transaction flows
- Implement robust error handling for API calls and contract interactions
- Add comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, and E2E tests)
- Test edge cases like defaulters attempting to borrow again

### 5. Performance & UX Improvements
- Optimize data fetching with SWR or React Query
- Add loading indicators and better error messaging
- Implement responsive design for all screen sizes
- Create informative tooltips and help guides for complex concepts

### 6. Advanced Features
- Governance mechanism for key parameters (if applicable)
- Analytics dashboard for platform-wide statistics
- Notifications for important events (liquidation risk, maturity approaching)
- Integration with additional collateral types beyond ETH/WLD

The project has a solid technical foundation with working authentication and verification. The main focus now should be implementing the core financial logic and connecting it to the frontend interface to create a fully functional DeFi lending platform.
